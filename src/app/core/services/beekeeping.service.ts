When bees are managed in hives, each hive houses a single colony.

While gathering nectar and pollen for honey production, bees engage in cross-pollination, contributing to over 90% of the world\'s flowering plants. This positions them as nature\'s foremost agriculturists and invaluable allies to farmers. Beyond bolstering productivity, bee pollination supports forestry conservation, maintains biodiversity, and ensures ecosystem functionality.',
