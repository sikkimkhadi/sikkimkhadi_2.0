        <h1>1. Introduction</h1>
        <p>Government of India has introduced a credit linked subsidy programme called Prime Minister's Employment
          Generation Programme (PMEGP). The essence of the programme is generation of employment opportunities through
          support in establishment of micro enterprises, which will be tiny hubs of employment. These micro enterprises
          can be in the form of small factories, production units, trade, shops and service sectors in rural as well as
          urban areas. PMEGP is a central sector scheme and a flagship programme of the Government of India.
          In Sikkim the scheme is being implemented through the Sikkim Khadi and Village Industries Boards (SKVIB),
          Deorali, Khadi & Village Industries Commission (KVIC) State Office and the District Industries Centres (DIC)
          under the Commerce & Industries Department Government subsidy under the scheme will be routed to the
          identified Banks for eventual distributions the beneficiaries/entrepreneurs in their bank accounts.

        <h1>2. Objectives of the Scheme</h1>
        <ol>
          <li> To generate employment opportunities in rural as well as urban areas of the country through setting up of
            new self-employment ventures/projects/micro enterprises. By providing support to one unemployed youth to
            become an entrepreneur, he/she will turn into an employer, providing jobs to many.</li>
          <li> To bring together widely dispersed rural and urban unemployed youth and give them self-employment
            opportunities to the extent possible, at their place so as to help arrest migration of rural youth to urban
            areas.</li>
          <li> To increase the wage earning capacity of workers and contribute to increase in the growth rate of rural
            and urban employment.</li>
