        <section>
            <h1>1. Background</h1>
            <p>Bee keeping is the rearing of bees for the purpose of obtaining honey. Honeybees live together in a
                highly organized group called a colony. When bees are managed in hives, each hives, each hive houses a
                single colony. professionally it is taken up under management practices for obtaining of not only honey
                but also for other hive products like bee wax, pollen, royal jelly and bee venom, which has many
                industrial uses with high market demand.</p>

            <h1>2. Introduction</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Beekeeping is a significant sustainable, and environmental sound activity involving integration of
                    forestry, social forestry and Agricultural supporting activity since it provides nutritional,
                    economic, and ecological balance, while providing employment and income. India has a good potential
                    for beekeeping and to become a major honey exporting nation.</li>
                <li>Beekeeping is a rewarding occupation yet yields profits from the 1 year of operation. It is a skill
                    industry having the potential to offer direct employment to lakhs of people especially hill
                    dwellers, tribal and unemployed youth and farmers. It offers a way for those with very few
                    resources-especially poor and landless farmers and women. Sustainability of this industry is
                    therefore vital to the country's economic wellbeing and development</li>
                <li>Beekeeping has been carried out across many generations in India. It plays a vital role in the
                    livelihoods of the rural communities in five dynamic ways:-</li>
                <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                    <li>(i) It is an income generating activity.</li>
                    <li>(ii) It provides food and medicine value of honey and other hive products are invaluable.</li>
                    <li>(iii) It supports agricultural activities through cross pollination and increase in yield of
                        crops.</li>
                    <li>(iv) It contributes immensely to forest conservation.</li>
                    <li>(v) It provides supplementary income to farmers/ Tribal etc.</li>

            <h1>3. Role of Bee-Keeping in Agriculture and the Eco-System</h1>
        </section>

        <section>
            <p>Bees and beekeeping not only yield direct and tangible benefits but also play a paramount role as
                essential
                pollinators for agriculture and natural ecosystems. While gathering nectar and pollen for honey
                production,
                bees engage in cross- pollination, contributing to over 90% of the world's flowering plants. This
                positions
                them as nature's foremost agriculturists and invaluable allies to farmers. Beyond bolstering
                productivity,
                bee pollination supports forestry conservation, maintains biodiversity, and ensures ecosystem
                functionality.
                The reduction in pollination can lead to the local extinction of plant species, a decline in fruit and
                seed-eating animals, loss of vegetation cover, and, ultimately, the deterioration of a healthy ecosystem
                and
                its services. Bees also actively combat soil degradation by enhancing the replenishment cycle: increased
                pollination results in more seed production, more plants, more biomass returned to the soil, thereby
                reducing soil erosion, minimizing flooding. and creating a more conducive environment for sustainable
                living.</p>

            <h1>4. Present scenario of Honey Production</h1>
        </section>

        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>India is among the major honey exporting countries. The major markets for Indian honey are Germany, USA,
                UK, Japan, France, Italy, Spain etc.</li>
            <li>India is at 8th position in the world for honey production.</li>
            <li>Honey production is estimated at 35,000 MTs for 2005-06 which has now increased to the estimated 95000
                MTs in 2017-18.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most of the Indian beekeepers engaged in beekeeping activity are primarily doing the extraction of raw honey
            from the bee colonies maintained by them. Very few beekeepers are extracting wax & pollen.
            The Raw honey extracted by beekeepers are procured by Beekeeper Cooperative Society/Beekeeping NGO/Honey
            Traders/ Pharmaceutical Companies etc. and in turn sent for processing through Honey Processing Plant and
            finally the processed honey gets packaged with suitable brand name for its sale to customers.

            <h1>5. Bee Keeping in the Context of Sikkim</h1>
            <p>Sikkim, primarily an agricultural state, has a deeply rooted tradition of beekeeping, especially within
                rural households, where it has been practiced for generations as a supplementary occupation. The sight
                of one or several bee colonies housed in carved hollow logs and wooden boxes is a common occurrence,
                underscoring the time-honoured legacy of beekeeping in Sikkim.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The state's rich floral resources and large forest coverage area and it having a predominantly agro-based
                rural economy gives ample scope for bee-farming to be taken up on a large scale.</p>
            <br>
            <p>In recent times, there has been a notable resurgence of interest in beekeeping. driven by the growing
                recognition of honey as an organic product with a niche and premium market. The state's unique
                geographical and ecological features contribute to the production of high-quality honey, positioning it
                as a sought- after commodity in the market. As Sikkim continues to leverage its agricultural heritage
                and embrace organic principles, beekeeping emerges not just as a traditional pursuit but as a promising
                avenue for economic growth, environmental conservation, and the promotion of premium organic products.

            <h1>6. Role of SKVIB in Development of Bee-Keeping Program:</h1>
            <p>SKVIB plays a pivotal role in the advancement of beekeeping programs aimed at enhancing the propagation
                of wild honey. The organization is actively involved in conducting awareness programs, providing
                beekeeping training. Additionally. SKVIB is committed to the manufacturing, sales and distribution of
                bee boxes across all districts , contributing to the widespread adoption of beekeeping practices.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Despite these efforts, the production of local honey and wild honey remains relatively low, hindering
                their availability on a commercial basis. The demand for honey, however, is high. It is evident that
                there is a gap between the demand and the current production levels. One notable observation is the
                limited presence of large-scale bee farms utilizing modern techniques in Sikkim.</p>
